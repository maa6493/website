## Python, the Computational Program
![](/blog/2019-12-15-python_files/pythonimage.jpeg)
Python is a computational program that allows users to use a varitey of packages and programs through its interface to conduct prcoedures needed in a variety of fields (i.e., computational biology or statistics in general). In our class for computational biology, we used the program R studio which can be used in conjuction with Python. For instance, down below is a tutorial on how to use Python along with the R Studio interface. I will show you some ways to use Python in R Studio in conjuction with a variety of functions that could be useful to you.

*You must use the library(reticulate) function in order to connect Python to R studio.*
```{r}
library(reticulate)
```

*Down below is where we use Python coding on R Studio interface! How cool!!*
```{python}
print("How is everyone doing today?")
```
*We can use Numpy as a way to have numerical computing in Python (i.e, we can use this for arrays as well!). This is shown down below.*

```{python}
import numpy as np
x=np.array([1,2,3])
x
```
```{python}
print(x/2+1) #vectorized arithmetic
```
```{python}
x.shape #size of array (attribute)
```

*We can use Numpy for basic numeric tests as well!*

```{python}
love = 4
pie = 3

love + pie
```
